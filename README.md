- I wanted to make a challenging, yet fun trivia game about one mf my favorite book series, Harry Potter. 
- There are 12 questions in total.
- Players will have 15 seconds to answer each multiple choice question.
- Whether they get the question correct, incorrect, or do not answer in time, they will then be shown a screen with the correct answer and a gif to accompany the message.
- At the end of the game, the user will be shown their end game results and have the option to play again.
